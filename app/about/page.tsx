          I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. In my early teens, I developed
          a curiosity for computers. Since then, I have been{' '}

          . Philosophy piqued my interest first<sup>1</sup>. School became
          boring for me rather quickly, so I started learning to code. I didn't
          want to sit in a classroom. I wanted to make things. This is when I
          began spending late nights<sup>2</sup> playing CTF challenges or
          building random programs. I installed Linux and bricked my computer
          often.

          At 16, I earned a scholarship to study at UWC ISAK Japan. This was a
          turning point in my life. I met some of my best friends and started
          getting my sh*t together<sup>3</sup>. I spent a fair amount of time
          getting better at programming. Feeling frustrated at the campus
          sign-out system, I built Matrix â€”a website to make it easier. This was
          the first project I built that people used.

          In 2020, I moved to Portland, Oregon, where I earned a Computer
          Science degree at Lewis & Clark College ('24). During my sophomore and
          junior summers, I interned at{' '}

            title="LinkedIn"
          />{' '}
          as a site reliability & software engineer, respectively. After that, I
          went on Semester at Sea where I traveled to 11 countries. I read
          Hackers & Painters and fell in love with the ethos of building and
          making things. Throughout the voyage, I developed an iOS app for a
          non-profit. During my four years in college, I doubled down on
          building side projects (like{' '}

          />
          ). However, my senior year was the most intense. I knew I wanted two
          things: a) build for a living, and b) start my own thing or join a
          startup.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I live in NYC working at an early-stage startup as a
          founding engineer. In my spare time, I am mostly working on a side
          project.
