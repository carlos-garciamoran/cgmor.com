          I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. In my early teens, I developed a curiosity for
          computers. Since then, I have been{' '}

          piqued my interest first<sup>1</sup>. School became boring for me rather quickly, so I
          started learning to code. I didn't want to sit in a classroom. I wanted to make things.
          This is when I began spending late nights
          <sup>2</sup> playing CTF challenges or building random programs. I installed Linux and
          bricked my computer often.

          At 16, I earned a scholarship to study at UWC ISAK Japan. This was a turning point in my
          life. I met some of my best friends and started getting my sh*t together<sup>3</sup>. I
          spent a fair amount of time getting better at programming. Feeling frustrated at the
          campus sign-out system, I built Matrix â€”a website to make it easier. This was the first
          project I built that people used.

          In 2020, I moved to Portland, Oregon, where I earned a Computer Science degree at Lewis &
          Clark College ('24). During my sophomore and junior summers, I interned at{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://linkedin.com/in/carlos-garcia-moran" title="LinkedIn" /> as a
          site reliability & software engineer, respectively. During my four years in college, I
          spent most building side projects (like{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/Mobilecn-UI/nativecn-ui" title="nativecn-ui" />
          ). However, my senior year was the most intense. I knew I wanted two things: a) build for
          a living, and b) start my own thing or join a startup.

          Currently, I live in NYC, where I work at an early-stage startup. In my spare time, I am
          currently working on something new...

            <sup>1</sup> Nietzsche made me think about my life. Diogenes showed me how simple it is
