          myself to code and began spending late nights
          <sup>2</sup> playing CTFs and hacking randomly. I fell down the computer security rabbit

          At 16, I studied abroad at UWC ISAK Japan. I met some of my best friends and started
          getting my sh*t together. I spent considerable time programming and developing my craft.
          At ISAK, I built Matrix â€”a website simplifying boarding school admin. It was the first
          project I made that people used.
