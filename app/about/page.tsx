          I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. In my early teens, I developed a curiosity for
          computers. Since then, I have been{' '}

          a bit of philosophy
          <sup>1</sup>, school became as boring as dreadful. Luckily, I had the internet. I taught
          myself to code and began spending late nights
          <sup>2</sup> playing CTFs and hacking randomly. I fell down the computer security rabbit
          hole, adopting Linux and bricking my computer often.

          At 16, I studied abroad at UWC ISAK Japan. I met some of my best friends and started
          getting my sh*t together. I spent a good amount of my time programming and developing my
          craft. At ISAK, I built Matrix â€”a website simplifying boarding school admin. It was the
          first project I made that people used.

          In 2020, I moved to the US and got my CS degree. I interned at LinkedIn as a sre and swe.
          Throughout college, I built a few side projects (e.g.,{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/Mobilecn-UI/nativecn-ui" title="nativecn-ui" />
          ).

          Currently, I live in NYC, where I work at an early-stage startup. In my spare time, I am
          working on something new...
