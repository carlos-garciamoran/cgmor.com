          I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. In my early teens, I developed a curiosity for
          computers. Since then, I have been{' '}

          piqued my interest first<sup>1</sup>. School became boring for me rather quickly, so I
          started learning to code. I didn't want to sit in a classroom. I wanted to make things.
          This is when I began spending late nights
          <sup>2</sup> playing CTF challenges or hacking randomly. I started using Linux bricking my
          computer often.

          At 16, I studied abroad at UWC ISAK Japan. I met some of my best friends and started
          getting my sh*t together<sup>3</sup>. I spent a fair amount of time getting better at
          programming. At ISAK, I built Matrix â€”a website simplifying boarding school admin stuff
          like sign in/out. This was the first project I built that people used.

          In 2020, I moved to the US. Got my CS degree at Lewis & Clark College ('24). I interned at{' '}

          ). My senior year was the most productive. Fell down the startup rabbit hole.

          Currently, I live in NYC, where I work at an early-stage startup. In my spare time, I am
